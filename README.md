# Unemployment rate forecasting of United States using ML
Unemployment rate (UR) is one of the most crucial metrics to convey the economic outlook of a country, affecting everyone on the socioeconomic spectrum. Effects of unemployment include a decrease in growth, capacity, individual purchasing power, and gross domestic product (GDP). Given this, accurately forecasting the UR has been a goal for many researchers and portfolio managers to gain an edge on the market. 

In this study, we will model UR using a data set comprised of macroeconomic metrics of the country being forecasted, UR of other countries, and retail food price data. We will use a variety of common methods in machine learning and compare the results with respect to the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for each model. 

ML Methods Used:

- Linear Regression
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
